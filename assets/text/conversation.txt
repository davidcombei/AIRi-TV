[ANCHOR]: Good day everyone, welcome to our show. Today we have with us David Combei, the author of the article "WavLM model ensemble for audio deepfake detection". Thank you for joining us, David.
[AUTHOR]: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.

[ANCHOR]: Let's start with the introduction. In the article, you mention that audio deepfake detection has become a crucial task in recent years due to the advancement of speech synthesis and voice cloning systems. Can you elaborate on that?
[AUTHOR]: Yes, certainly. With the rapid progress in generative deep learning, it has become increasingly challenging to distinguish between real and generated audio data. This has raised concerns about the potential misuse of audio deepfake technology, such as impersonation or alteration of original audio resources.

[ANCHOR]: That's a great point. In the article, you mention that self-supervised representations are a popular choice for audio deepfake detection. Can you explain what self-supervised learning is and how it applies to this task?
[AUTHOR]: Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that aims to produce transferable representations by training models on unlabelled data. In the context of audio deepfake detection, self-supervised representations can be used to learn features that are effective for distinguishing between real and fake audio data.

[ANCHOR]: I see. You also mention that the wav2vec family of models is a popular option for deepfake detection. Can you elaborate on why wav2vec is considered a good choice?
[AUTHOR]: Yes, wav2vec is a well-known framework for self-supervised learning of speech representations. It masks the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantisation of the latent representations. This has been shown to be effective for a variety of downstream tasks, including speech recognition and keyword spotting.

[ANCHOR]: That's interesting. In the article, you present some results from the ASVspoof5 challenge, which is a benchmark for audio deepfake detection. Can you walk us through the results and what they mean?
[AUTHOR]: Sure. In the ASVspoof5 challenge, we evaluated the performance of various self-supervised representations on the task of deepfake detection. We found that the wavLM model, which is a variant of the wav2vec framework, achieved the best performance. Specifically, it achieved an equal error rate (EER) of 9.93% on the development set.

[ANCHOR]: That's a good result. You also mention that you finetuned the wavLM model for the deepfake detection task. Can you explain why you chose to finetune the model and what benefits it brought?
[AUTHOR]: Yes, we chose to finetune the wavLM model because we wanted to adapt it to the specific task of deepfake detection. By finetuning the model, we were able to improve its performance on the task, achieving an EER of 0.61% on the development set.

[ANCHOR]: I see. In the article, you also present some results from the final evaluation set. Can you walk us through those results and what they mean?
[AUTHOR]: Sure. In the final evaluation set, we achieved an EER of 6.56% on the progress phase evaluation set and 17.08% on the final evaluation set. This indicates that our model is able to generalize well to unseen data and perform well on the task of deepfake detection.

[ANCHOR]: That's a great result. You also mention that you used a late fusion combination of four models to achieve the final result. Can you explain why you chose to use late fusion and what benefits it brought?
[AUTHOR]: Yes, we chose to use late fusion because we wanted to combine the strengths of multiple models to achieve better performance. By combining the predictions of four models, we were able to achieve an EER of 6.56% on the progress phase evaluation set and 17.08% on the final evaluation set.

[ANCHOR]: I see. Finally, what do you think are the key takeaways from this research and how can they be applied in practice?
[AUTHOR]: I think the key takeaway is that self-supervised representations, such as wavLM, can be effective for audio deepfake detection. Additionally, finetuning these models for the specific task can improve their performance. Finally, late fusion can be a useful technique for combining the strengths of multiple models to achieve better performance.

[ANCHOR]: Thank you, David, for sharing your insights with us today. It's been a pleasure having you on the show.
[AUTHOR]: Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure. 

[ANCHOR]: Before we go, is there anything else you'd like to add or any final thoughts you'd like to share with our audience?
[AUTHOR]: Yes, I'd like to emphasize the importance of developing effective audio deepfake detection systems to mitigate the potential risks associated with this technology. I believe that this research can contribute to this effort and help to improve the security and integrity of audio data.

[ANCHOR]: Thank you, David, for that final thought. It's been a pleasure having you on the show.
[AUTHOR]: Thank you.

[ANCHOR]: And that's all the time we have for today. Thank you to our audience for tuning in and to David Combei for joining us.
[AUTHOR]: Thank you.

[ANCHOR]: We'll be back with more exciting topics and guests soon. Until then, goodbye and stay safe.
[AUTHOR]: Goodbye.
